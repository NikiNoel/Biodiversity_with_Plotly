# Biodiversity_with_Plotly
Creating an interactive biodiversity web page designed with the use of plotly.js, html, css, d3, and bootstrap


# Background
Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.


# Results
* The web page is designed to be a quick refrence for volunteers to look up their information. 

* Future improvements could add information regarding what bacteria the research team is looking for and how the volunteers information compares.  

* The gauge for WFREQ could be better formatted to for a scale of 1-7, covering the number of days in a week.

* The bar chart could be altered to show more consistent values, maybe using a percentage of the participants bacteria. Or note if the research team is looking for a set value for any given bacteria.
